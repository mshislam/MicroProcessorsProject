Message Passing Interface ( MPI ) is a standardized and portable message-passing standard designed by a group of researchers from academia 
and industry to function on a wide variety of parallel computing architectures .
 The standard defines the syntax and semantics of a core of library routines useful to a wide range of users writing portable message-passing programs 
 in C , C++ , and Fortran . There are several well-tested and efficient implementations of MPI , many of which are open-source or in the public domain .
  These fostered the development of a parallel software industry , and encouraged development of portable and scalable large-scale parallel applications
